## Instructions from Balvinder

Hi Adam,

Please find attached the code for orbeon ml api (THE TWO ZIP FILES),

This is roxy app so ‘local bootstrap’ and 'deploy modules’ (change local properties appropriately)
Place the orbeon-ml-api/orbeon-props/properties-local.xml file under <tomcat>/webapps/orbeon/WEB-INF/resources/config (if you change the port in local properties change it in this file as well)
Start playing with form builder and form runner
Please find attached some of the erdf forms for reference.

Thanks,
Balvinder
